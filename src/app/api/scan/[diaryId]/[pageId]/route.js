 * Either way the caller just requests /api/scan/<pageId>.

 * This route serves the actual scan images, which makes it the most important
 * thing to protect. It decides for itself rather than trusting the proxy: if the
 * proxy were ever bypassed, this is the endpoint that would hand over everything.
 *
 * It no longer requires a session, because a volume marked `public` must be
 * readable without one. What it requires instead is canSee(), against the
 * visibility that arrives with the row -- so an anonymous caller gets a public
 * volume's images and a 404 for anything else. The permission question moved; it
