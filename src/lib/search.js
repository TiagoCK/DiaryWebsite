 * kind of thing that is easy to get subtly wrong, and this way they can be
 * exercised directly.
 *
 * Filtering happens in the app rather than in Postgres because getPages()
 * already loads every row's metadata on every render. Doing it in SQL would
 * mean two matching rules -- ilike folds case by its own collation and would
 * quietly disagree with the filter running in the browser. See the README for
 * the point at which that trade stops being worth it.
