/**
 * Refreshes the Supabase session cookie, and redirects where it is useful to.
 *
 * Named `proxy` because `middleware` is deprecated in Next 16 -- same
 * behaviour, different filename and export. One consequence worth knowing:
 * `proxy` runs on the nodejs runtime, not edge, and that is not configurable.
 *
 * This is NOT the security boundary. It is a session refresher and a friendly
 * redirect. Next.js has had a middleware-bypass vulnerability before
 * (CVE-2025-29927, a spoofable x-middleware-subrequest header); 16.3.3 is
 * patched, but a gate with a single layer is the wrong shape regardless.
 *
 * Every protected surface re-checks for itself:
 *   src/app/page.js                              getViewer()  <- may be nobody
 *   src/app/d/[slug]/page.js                     getViewer() + requireDiary()
 *   src/app/api/scan/[diaryId]/[pageId]/route.js canSee()     <- serves the images
 *   src/app/search/page.js                       requireUser()
 *   src/app/admin/page.js                        requireAdmin()
 *   src/app/admin/actions.js                     requireAdmin()
 */

/*
 * Paths a signed-out visitor is still bounced from.
 *
 * This used to be the inverse -- an allowlist of public paths, with everything
 * else redirected to /login. It had to flip, because a volume marked `public`
 * must be readable with no session at all: the shelf, the reader and the image
 * route now serve a viewer who may be nobody, and canSee() decides what such a
 * viewer gets.
 *
 * Flipping an allowlist into a denylist is normally how things end up
 * accidentally open, and it is tolerable here for one specific reason: this was
 * never the gate. Every surface listed in the comment above re-checks for
 * itself, so a new route that forgets to appear here is still protected by its
 * own requireAdmin() or requireUser() -- which is the pattern every route in
 * this app already follows. Adding a route without its own check would be the
 * bug, and it would be a bug with or without this list.
